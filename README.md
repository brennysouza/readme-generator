## Description 
This is a readme generator focused on assisting users to construct a well structured read me file with necessary information needed. Most do not know how to construct a read me. Therefore the aim of this is to help those who do not know what to do. Some of my bootcamp fellow students were having trouble before. This is a great application to help them.

## Installation
Users should open the index.js file inside their local machine, open a new terminal, run npm i, run node index.js, and proceed to answer questions that will show in terminal.

## Usage
Please refer to installation section of README.
